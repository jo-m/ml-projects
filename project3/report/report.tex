\section*{Experimental Protocol}
Suppose that someone wants to reproduce your results. Briefly describe the steps used to obtain the
predictions starting from the  data set. The following
sections are suggested to explain your methodology. Feel free to add sections,  graphs or screenshots if you think it's
necessary. 
Feel free to change the overall procedure you use to describe your
methodology. 
%The report should contain a maximum of 2 pages.
Please keep the report in 4 pages, figures and references
are not included in the space limit. 

\section{Tools}
Which tools and libraries have you used (e.g. Matlab, Python with scikit-learn, Java with Weka,
SPSS, language x with library y, $\ldots$). If you have source-code (Matlab scripts, Python scripts, Java source folder, \dots),
make sure to submit it on the project website together with this report. If you only used
command-line or GUI-tools describe what you did.

\section{Algorithm}
Describe the algorithm you used.

\section{Feature Engineering}
Did you construct any new features? What feature transforms did you use?
Did you do feature selection?   What kind of performance improvement 
did you gain from each feature engineering technique? etc 

\section{Parameters}
How did you find the parameters of your model? (What parameters have you searched over, cross validation procedure, $\ldots$)

\section{Lessons Learned} What other algorithms, tools or methods did you try out that didn't work well?
Why do you think they performed worse than what you used for your final submission?

\section*{References}

Add references if needed.
